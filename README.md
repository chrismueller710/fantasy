# fantasy
An exploratory analysis of the 2022 Fantasy Football season and who scores the most points.
Full Disclosure: I worked on this project as a part of my Introduction to Programming in SAS class with a partner, so not all of the work is mine. I have also removed their name from the project.
This project is what some might call "not good", as we didn't really have a good goal for this. This also isn't really that impactful of a dataset.
The dataset for this project was put together by me using the information available on: https://www.pro-football-reference.com
